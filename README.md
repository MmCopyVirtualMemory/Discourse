Discourse on game hacking.

Throughout the past few years, I have found game hacking to be one of my most consistient hobbies outside of my real life activities. I entered the hobby with a little bit of programming knowledge but I had very little to no knowledge of how anything worked on a lower level. I quickly got pwned right off the bat by more experienced individuals. At the time I had felt wronged however as I have been in this scene for a little while, I have learned that what they did was completely necessary. Because game hacking appeals to a much younger and dumber audience, most of the people that come into the subject are absolutely brainless. This process of individual filtration is essential for the eventual development of the game hacking community. 

Because of this, the community is filled a crude mixture of intelligent individuals and toxic idiots that gaslit themselves into thinking they could code. One can reasonably expect little to no assistance when starting off in the game hacking scene because of the community. As one develops and refines their skills, the amount of people that can help with problems depletes. In this way, the process of individual filtration is given validation.
