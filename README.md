# Discourse On Game Hacking

## Background

Throughout the past few years, I have found game hacking to be one of my most consistient hobbies outside of my real life activities. It's a very unique hobby and I haven't found anything close to it. As I leave for college I plan on leaving most of this behind for the future game hackers like myself.

## Community

I entered the hobby with a little bit of programming knowledge but I had very little to no knowledge of how anything worked on a lower level. I quickly got pwned right off the bat by more experienced individuals. At the time I had felt wronged however as I have been in this scene for a little while, I have learned that what they did was completely necessary. Because game hacking appeals to a much younger and dumber audience, most of the people that come into the subject are absolutely brainless. This process of individual filtration is essential for the eventual development of the game hacking community. Because of this, the community is filled a crude mixture of intelligent individuals and toxic losers who gaslit themselves into thinking they could code. One can reasonably expect little to no assistance when starting off in the game hacking scene because of the community. As one develops and refines their skills, the amount of people that can help with problems depletes. In this way, the process of individual filtration is given validation. The sad truth with game hacking is that there is no support. Often times if you are writing something of value, you are the first person to do it and therefore nobody else can help. In addition, there is an incentive (sometimes monetary) to keep secrets close to the chest. Contrary to modern collaborative development, game hacking is very competitive and degenerative however in my case, this brought out a new appreciation for the structure of modern society. One thing that is very positive is that most communities work based on merit which means the intelligent individuals are seldom supressed, regardless of opinion or mannerisms. The community for game hacking is very different from any other coding community.

## Moral Implications & Ethics

Game hacking is morally frowned upon by most people so it takes a (somewhat) twisted moral compass to develop these softwares. I don't think I have ever discussed the moral implications of game hacking with anyone in the scene which goes to show how quickly looked over they are. For the sake of transparency, I will share my own opion on the ethics behind game hacking. I always found it funny when a hacker killed me in games. It was never something negative and it usually took away the tension when I figured out someone was hacking. It was always a game for me to figure out if someone was cheating and often there was no loss if they were (because of elo & loot compenstation systems when they are banned). From my perspective, losing to a cheater wasn't the end of the world. As someone who primarily closet cheats in games, I don't see much of a moral problem for the following reasons. People need to learn how to lose with grace. Every other clip I see of someone dying in a game is a frustrated ape who has never lost anything in their life. Often times cheating accusations are thrown around without any substance. As someone who never plays outside the bounds of what a good player could do, players should never suspect me of cheating. Thus they should have no reason to be mad at me or the game. In layman's terms, no harm to foul. The only person's experience that changed in this situation is mine. I know this logic is very flawed but this is coming from my own opinion and personal experience.

## Challenges & Programming

It's difficult for one to find many solid examples to start learning game hacking. I hypothesize this is the case for two main reasons. Firstly, the more experienced developers who write nice, legible code are often incentivised not to share their code because of the intrinsic value that unshared code has and the reasons mentioned earlier. The second reason is because less experienced developers freely share their code. For this reason, many publicly available game hacks are very low quality. Often times the "developers" have never been clasically trained. They don't understand basic CS concepts like data structures and algorithms. Often times public code is very messy and not uniform, especially because there is no industry standard. With incompetent children (apes) running around and posting their code (often a hollow attempt at reputation or merit), the status quo and standard of these game hacking projects drops to a minimum.

For these reasons, it's very difficult to properly learn from public information. As an example, I recently wrote/rewrote a driver mapper. I used kdmapper as an example but the code was so poorly written that I wasted close to 2 hours refactoring it. I was able to condense the cleaning code into 1/10 the length of what it originally was by making a few logical assumptions that Cruz should have already made. Typically I avoid these public sources altogether.

On the actual development side of things, not much changes from normal (non game hacking) programming besides the fact that most of what you code is based on preconcieved assumptions. From my experience however, the highs and lows from developing game hacks are much greater than that of typical development. There have been times where I had a mental block for about a week at the maximum where I couldn't figure out my mistake. A large part of my challenge was working without a debugger (on a protected game). Once I figured out how to solve the issue however, the dopamine hit I got was amongst the largest I have experienced. Along with dopamine, there is also an element of adrenaline that comes with developing in these "higher stakes" programs.

## Recomendations

I wouldn't recommend game hacking to someone who doesn't love playing videogames. As I grew older, my love for gaming diminished. I still play games but not to the degree I did before and my interest in game hacking has suffered because of it.

## Showcase

Below I have attached a few images of hacks I have coded. I have cheated in many of these games for many years without ever being banned. As always, there are many imperfections and I often only coded until what I wrote fit my needs. I never intended to please anyone besides myself with my code or the visuals so I ask you to take them as they are. 

**None of these cheats were used in a competitive environment in any game and they were never distributed. Game devs rest easy.**
