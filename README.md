# Discourse on game hacking.

## Background

Throughout the past few years, I have found game hacking to be one of my most consistient hobbies outside of my real life activities. It's a very unique hobby and I haven't found anything close to it.

## Community

I entered the hobby with a little bit of programming knowledge but I had very little to no knowledge of how anything worked on a lower level. I quickly got pwned right off the bat by more experienced individuals. At the time I had felt wronged however as I have been in this scene for a little while, I have learned that what they did was completely necessary. Because game hacking appeals to a much younger and dumber audience, most of the people that come into the subject are absolutely brainless. This process of individual filtration is essential for the eventual development of the game hacking community. Because of this, the community is filled a crude mixture of intelligent individuals and toxic losers who gaslit themselves into thinking they could code. One can reasonably expect little to no assistance when starting off in the game hacking scene because of the community. As one develops and refines their skills, the amount of people that can help with problems depletes. In this way, the process of individual filtration is given validation. The sad truth with game hacking is that there is no support. Often times if you are writing something of value, you are the first person to do it and therefore nobody else can help. In addition, there is an incentive (sometimes monetary) to keep secrets close to the chest. Contrary to modern collaborative development, game hacking is very competitive and degenerative however in my case, this brought out a new appreciation for the structure of modern society. One thing that is very positive is that most communities work based on merit which means the intelligent individuals are seldom supressed, regardless of opinion or mannerisms.

## Moral Implications & Ethics
Game hacking is morally frowned upon by most people so it takes a (somewhat) twisted moral compass to develop these softwares. I don't think I have ever discussed the moral implications of game hacking with anyone in the scene which goes to show how quickly looked over they are. For the sake of transparency, I will share my own opion on the ethics behind game hacking. I always found it funny when a hacker killed me in games. It was never something negative and it usually took away the tension when I figured out someone was hacking. It was always a game for me to figure out if someone was cheating and often there was no loss if they were (because of elo & loot compenstation systems when they are banned). From my perspective, losing to a cheater wasn't the end of the world. As someone who cheats in games, 

## Showcase

Below I have attached a few images of hacks I have coded. I have cheated in many of these games for many years without ever being banned. As always, there are many imperfections and I often only coded until what I wrote fit my needs. I never inteneded to please anyone besides myself with my code. **None of these cheats were used in a competitive environment in any game and they were never distributed. Game devs rest easy.**
